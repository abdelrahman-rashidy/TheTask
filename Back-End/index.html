	1- the first way to solve that problem is to increse server timeout by this php.ini( bool set_time_limit ( int $seconds ) )86400 S for 18 Hour 

		php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php

	2- the secend way is using ajax to change the value of server time out ( I am not sure of that if it will work effectively or no )
